# HS-AlbSig-LaTeX-Template
This is a template for any scientific work done at the **HS AlbSig**.

Have a look at the [PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laeberkaes/HS-AlbSig-LaTeX-Template/master/vorlage.pdf).

## HowTo
Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/laeberkaes/HS-AlbSig-LaTeX-Template.git`. Now you can start editing the files. You can build the pdf with `pdflatex vorlage.tex`.

The main file is `vorlage.tex`. In this file all other files are included. So if you want to change something or add other sections you should do it the same way.

This repository will be continued on [gitea](https://gitea.uraltemorla.xyz/laeberkaes/HS-AlbSig-LaTeX-Template). There will be a Beamer Template as well.
